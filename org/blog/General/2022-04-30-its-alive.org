** It's alive!

After lots of head scratching, the site is alive! The site has been created using Emacs (via the Portacle package) and the built-in org-mode, the 
publishing utility of org-mode has been utilised to generate static HTML files from ~org~ files.

Keep an eye out for more posts surrounding setting up this blog with Emacs and org-mode.
