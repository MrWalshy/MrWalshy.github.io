<h1>What is JShell?</h1>
<p>#+DATE: &#x3C;2022-05-13></p>
<p>JShell is a REPL tool, Read-Eval-Print-Loop, for experimenting with Java code to get immediate results.</p>

<h2>Opening JShell</h2>
<p>
  To open the JShell tool, ensure you have Java on your system path and enter jshell into the console.
  You should see something like the following if JShell opened correctly:
</p>
<pre><code>$ jshell 
| Welcome to JShell -- Version 17.0.1 
| For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> 
</code></pre>
<h2>Useful commands</h2>
<p>The following commands will be useful for interacting with JShell:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Command</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/exit</code></td>
      <td>Exits the JShell tool</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/list</code></td>
      <td>Lists a history of executed code snippets</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/save snippet.txt</code></td>
      <td>Saves all entered code snippets in the current session to the specified file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/open snippet.txt</code></td>
      <td>Opens and loads the code snippets from the specified file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/reset</code></td>
      <td>Resets the state of the JShell tool, deleting all snippets in its history</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/help</code></td>
      <td>Opens the help menu</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>/vars</code></td>
      <td>Lists declared variables</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h2>Exploratory programming</h2>
<p>In Java, we can perform the standard Arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If I enter <code>3 + 3;</code> into JShell for example, I will get the following result:</p>
<pre><code>jshell> 3 + 3; 
$1 ==> 6 
</code></pre>
<p>What has happened here is that the Java code has been executed and a temporary variable has been created to store the result of the addition, a <em>variable</em> stores data for us and has an associated name. If I enter the name of the new variable, <code>$1</code>, into the console it will return <code>$1 ==> 6</code> â€“ this is informing us that the variable named <code>$1</code> points to the value of <code>6</code>. We can also pass a variable as input to a method, where a <em>method</em> is just a reusable block of code with a name, such as with the <code>println()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>jshell> System.out.println($1); 
6
</code></pre>
<p>Try entering the following expressions into JShell and noting their results:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>3 * 3</code></li>
  <li><code>3 / 3</code></li>
  <li><code>3 / 0</code></li>
  <li><code>3 - 3</code></li>
  <li><code>(3 + 3) * 3</code></li>
  <li><code>3 + 3 * 3</code></li>
</ul>
