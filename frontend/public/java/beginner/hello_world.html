<h1>The canonical Hello World</h1>
<p>A commonality amongst programmers is that in any new language we meet, we write a <code>“Hello World!”</code> program – a simple application which will output those exact words to the screen.</p>
<hr>
<p>To follow along, first create a new file called <code>Runner.java</code> in a directory of your choice:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">mkdir hello-world 
cd hello-world 
touch Runner.java 
</code></pre>
<p>The above <code>touch</code> command is not available on WIndows by default, please ensure if on Windows you are using Git Bash or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)... Or you could just use <code>echo</code> with the redirection operator like so: <code>echo > Runner.java</code> :)</p>
<p>Once we have created the file, type <code>notepad Runner.java</code> to open the file in the Notepad application on Windows or use <code>nano Runner.java</code> to use the nano text editor in the console (Git Bash on Windows only, usually preinstalled on Linux/GNU based systems). Then type in the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Runner { 

    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println(“Hello world”); 
    } 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have entered the code, save, and exit back to the console. Then type the following commands (except comments starting with a hash symbol) to compile and run our code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># compile the Runner.java file as a class file using the javac tool 
javac Runner.java 
# run the compiled class file (which is in the same directory) using the java tool 
# - do not specify .class or the compiled file will not be executed 
java Runner
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li>Adding <code>.class</code> to the java Runner command will produce a class loader error, where the JVM was not able to load the specified class file.</li>
</ul>
<p>If done correctly, you will see something like the following outputted in the console window:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Morgan Walsh@DESKTOP-LT9E09K MINGW64 ~/hello-world 
$ javac Runner.java

Morgan Walsh@DESKTOP-LT9E09K MINGW64 ~/hello-world 
$ java Runner Hello world
</code></pre>
<h2>Program breakdown</h2>
<p>A lot is going on in the background to make our program run, we are already aware of this; now it is time to investigate the structure of how we write our programs.</p>
<hr>
<p>Java is an object-oriented language, it uses the construct of a class to represent a component in a software system – a component could be the representation of physical things like a customer, an animal, a tree or even non-tangible logical things like mathematical formula or graphs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A class is a blueprint which defines the data and behaviours that describe some object.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Hello World example, we create a class called <code>Runner</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Runner {

}
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li>The first line declaring the class, <code>public class Runner</code>, is known as the class header.</li>
  <li><code>public</code> is a special Java keyword known as an access modifier, just know that for now it means that any other class can use the class called <code>Runner</code>.</li>
  <li><code>class</code> is another Java keyword used to signify that we are creating a class, a blueprint.</li>
  <li><code>Runner</code> is the name of the class, we can choose a name other than <code>Runner</code> if we would like.</li>
  <li>The curly braces signify the body of the class, this contains code that belongs to the class.</li>
  <li>Code outside of a class is an error in Java, Java code must live inside a class aside from package declarations, imports, and class declarations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the class body, there is a special unit of code known as a method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void main(String[] args) { 
    System.out.println(“Hello world”);
}
</code></pre>
<p>A method is a self-contained, reusable block of code that can be called/invoked by another method. The main method shown above is a special type of method that indicates to the JVM that the program should start here.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> is the method header, this identifies the methods accessibility, output, name, and inputs.</li>
  <li>All of the code between the curly braces after the method header is in the method body, this is the code that is executed when a method is invoked and belongs only to that method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Complete instructions of code in Java, aside from blocks of curly brackets, must end with a semi-colon to be valid. The semi-colon used to terminate a programming statement is known as a delimiter.</p>
<p>To invoke a method, we specify the name of the method followed by a set of parentheses. In the previous example, we use a special method called <code>println()</code>, accessible via a field (a piece of memory storing data) on the <code>System</code> class, to print output to the console. If we called that method without any input, it would look like: <code>System.out.println();</code></p>
<ul>
  <li>An empty <code>println()</code> statement would print a new line character to the console (an empty line) as we have not passed it any input inside its parenthesis.</li>
</ul>
